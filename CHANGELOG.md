# Changelog

This changelog starts with the v3.2 platform direction. For the changelog up to v3.1, see the
[`v3.1` branch](https://github.com/allors/allors3/blob/v3.1/CHANGELOG.md).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
[version.json](version.json) specifies `3.2.0-alpha.{height}` for development builds.
Changes accumulate under **[Unreleased]** until a version is released.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Documentation for users and maintainers under `docs/`, starting with the domain model:
  functional domains, plug-ins and their hosts, and the concrete domain that selects plug-ins.
  `AGENTS.md` holds the rules for these pages.

### Changed

- Document the v3.2 platform scope: System, Core, and a planned Identity domain for
  authentication, continued domain inheritance, and a planned signals-based API for the .NET and
  TypeScript workspaces with thin UI integrations. Base and Apps are to be removed without a
  separate continuation; their removal, the Identity domain, and the reactive workspace changes
  have not landed yet.
- Update development guidance for the platform scope, a default pull-request workflow in which
  creating a pull request requires approval, one pull request per agreed body of work with a
  correct title and description, Purpose Prefixes for branch names, and changelog handling for
  changes ported between branches.
- Start a new changelog from this point; the changelog up to v3.1 remains on the `v3.1` branch.

### Removed

- The obsolete bugfix integration review checklist.
- The `CLAUDE.md` symlink to `AGENTS.md`. Claude Code reads `AGENTS.md` directly from version
  2.1.277.
- Dependabot version updates for the GitHub Actions used in the workflows. Action versions are
  updated by hand.

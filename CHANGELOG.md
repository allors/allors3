# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning)
(`3.1.0-alpha.{height}`), so the version auto-increments with each commit on `main`.
Changes accumulate under **[Unreleased]** until a version is cut, at which point they move
under a dated version heading.

## [Unreleased]

<!-- Add entries under one of: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security -->

### Fixed

- E2E tests no longer fail on transient browser network errors (`net::ERR_NO_BUFFER_SPACE` and
  similar socket/connection errors) that surface sporadically on CI. The console-error assertion
  now ignores this known-transient class while still catching real JS errors and HTTP 4xx/5xx
  resource failures.
- SqlClient adapter tests now run with a 300s command timeout and `Connection Timeout=0` against
  SQL Server LocalDB, matching the Npgsql adapter tests. This stops sporadic CI failures
  (`SqlException: Execution Timeout Expired`) caused by LocalDB slowness on hosted runners.
